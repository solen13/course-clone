    <h1 class="questions-title">Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <p class="questions-paragraph">
      A Terms and Conditions is not required and it's not mandatory by law. Unlike Privacy
      Policies, which are required by laws such as the GDPR, CalOPPA and many others, there's no
      law or regulation on Terms and Conditions.


      However, having a Terms and Conditions gives you the right to terminate the access of
      abusive users or to terminate the access to users who do not follow your rules and guid
      elines, as well as other desirable business benefits.

      It's extremely important to have this agreement if you operate a SaaS app.
      <br><br>
      Here are a few examples of how this agreement can help you:

      If users abuse your website or mobile app in any way, you can terminate their account. Your
      "Termination" clause can inform users that their accounts would be terminated if they abuse
      your service.
      If users can post content on your website or mobile app (create conte
      nt and share it on your platform), you can remove any content they crea
      ted if it infringes copyright. Your Terms and Conditions will inform users t
      hat they can only create and/or
      share content they own rights to. Similarly, if users can regis
      ter for an account and choose a username, you can inform users that they are
      not allowed to choose usernames that may infringe trademarks, i.e. usernames lik
      e Google, Facebook, and so on.
      If you sell products or services, you could cancel specific
      orders if a product price is incorrect. Your Terms and Conditions can include a
      clause to inform users that certain orders, at your sole discretion, can be cancel
      ed if the products ordered have incorrect prices due to various errors.
